# Text-to-Image Generation with ControlNet guidance

## StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline

ControlNet by [@lllyasviel](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel) is a neural network structure to control diffusion models by adding extra conditions.

It has integration with Stable Diffusion and 8 pre-trained models that conditions the models on different attributes 
(such as edge detection, scribbles, depth maps, semantic segmentations and more)

The original codebase can be found here:
